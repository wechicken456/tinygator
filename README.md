My tiny [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) feed aggregator in Go. RSS feeds are a way for websites to publish updates to their content. You can use this project to keep up with your favorite blogs, news sites, comic books, and more!

It will be a CLI tool that allows users to:
- Add RSS feeds from across the internet to be collected
- Store the collected posts in a PostgreSQL database
- Follow and unfollow RSS feeds that other users have added
- View summaries of the aggregated posts in the terminal, with a link to the full post
